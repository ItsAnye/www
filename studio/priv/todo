GET RID OF ALL JAVASCRIPT HTML - USE HTML THAT IS HIDDEN, JAVASCRIPT JUST TO TRIGGER
Make a test feature which runs an iframe (or smth), seperate from visual editor (the thing you see while editing)!
Insert Sphere
Insert Spotlights
Spotlight "fine line" property
For insert object, create a dropdown menu rather than custom div -_-
Edit tab should only work if there is a rig loaded AND selected, not just loaded
