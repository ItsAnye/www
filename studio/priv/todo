Make a test feature which runs an iframe (or smth), seperate from visual editor (the thing you see while editing)!
When object is inserted, insert at random x + y position (integers only)
Insert Spotlights
Spotlight "fine line" property
For insert object, create a dropdown menu rather than custom div -_-
Edit tab should only work if there is a rig loaded AND selected, not just loaded
Delete objects
