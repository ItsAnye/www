STUDIO SELECTION IS ALL FUCKED UP - make separate classes like li-select, obj-select, rig-select...

Fix Background color on buttons in header
When Rig is loaded, edit tab color slider doesn't change rig skin color
For selecting in explorer, rather than deselecting then selecting again (2 clicks), do it all in one click.

Rig is no longer selectable in any way
When material is changed, make sure opacity is still set to slider value (currently it will show as 1 even if slider is something else)

Spotlights:

SpotLight's position settings are acting wierd.
Cant select lights after rig loaded :(
SPOTLIGHT POSITION SHOULD CHANGE SPOTLIGHT POSITION
SPOTLIGHT ROTATION SHOULD CHANGE SPOTLIGHT TARGET POSTION!!!!!
