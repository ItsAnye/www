Thumbnails (1:1)
Pictures on game page (5:3)

When game is published, ask for thumbnail, game page picture, bg color on hover, and create a folder under /play with their game name (lowercase and ' ' is replaced by '_'), do this using Python/Flask backend.
Also give them chance to change font-size if it doesn't fit properly by default.

Use w3schools color coding, and website design for learn.*

Color coding: Some tags don't show on innerHTML, like <head>, <p> doesn't show a closing tag?

Checkmark on TODO page is checkable sometimes, try making it on your own.

On home page, when you scroll, gear icon moves too, make it fixed/sticky?
