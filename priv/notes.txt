Thumbnails (1:1)
Pictures on game page (5:3)

When game is published, ask for thumbnail, game page picture, bg color on hover, text color on hover, and manual adjustment of font-size. Create a folder under /play with their game name (lowercase and ' ' is replaced by '_'), do this using Python/Flask backend.
Also give them chance to change font-size if it doesn't fit properly by default.
